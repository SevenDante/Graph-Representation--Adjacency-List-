# Linked-LIst-Representation-Of-Graph

There is a great way to represent a graph(G=(V,E) (directed/undirected). This gonna save time as well as space (in case of Sparse Graph(G=(V,E).
Representing it with the help of "structure" makes it cumbersome & difficult to implement.
So with the help of Standard Template Library(STL) in C++ i've implemented it.
